    Runs weka J48 decison tree algorithm on a phenotype set.  Results currently output to Report.
    Currently assumes the base media is always the same, only additional compounds change.
    Request upgrades as needed.

    <p>This app runs Weka J48 decision tree classifier on a phenotype set.  A classification algorithm takes a set of data defined by attributes and a class value.  The class value is expected to be determined by the set of attributes.  A classifier works to define the class value based on attributes.  We use this algorithm to visualize data (not to predict new unseen data - though it can be used to do so).</p> 

    <p>This app is useful to understand data large data sets with many attributes and a single class value.  The attributes could be: compounds in a media, genes expressed, temperature, pH, etc.  The class value should be some sort of phenotype: growth, physical structure, etc.  The decision tree will give you a visual representation of how the attributes affect the phenotype.</p>

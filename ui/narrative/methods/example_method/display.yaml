    Runs weka J48 classification tree algorithm on a phenotype set.  Results currently output to Report.
    Currently assumes the base media is always the same, only additional compounds change.
    Request upgrades as needed.

        ui-name : | 
            Confidence Factor
        short-hint : | 
            The confidence factor used for pruning (smaller values incur more pruning).
        long-hint : | 
            The confidence factor used for pruning (smaller values incur more pruning).  (See Weka specs for more).

    minNumObj :
        ui-name : |

            Num Folds
        short-hint : | 
            Determines the amount of data used for reduced-error pruning.  One fold is used for pruning, the rest for growing the tree.

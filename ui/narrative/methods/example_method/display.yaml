        ui-name : | 
            Confidence Factor
        short-hint : | 
            The confidence factor used for pruning (smaller values incur more pruning).
        long-hint : | 
            The confidence factor used for pruning (smaller values incur more pruning).  (See Weka specs for more).

    minNumObj :
        ui-name : | 
            Min Num Obj
        short-hint : | 
            The minimum number of instances per leaf.
